# Fame Engineering — Website

A simple, fast, single-page website for Fame Engineering (electrical &amp; electronics
repair). Plain HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no framework, no server required.

## Files

```
index.html        Main page (all sections)
css/styles.css     All styling
js/main.js         Mobile menu + small helpers
images/logo.jpg        Shop logo (header + favicon)
images/proprietor.jpg  Rana Shabir Ahmad portrait (About section)
```

## Before you launch — fill these in

Real business details from the letterhead (phone numbers, address, email,
proprietor name, services list, and logo) are already filled in. What's
still left:

- [x] Contact form — wired to Formspree (`https://formspree.io/f/xgaeneny`).
      **One thing left:** Formspree emails a confirmation link the first time
      a real submission comes in — someone needs to submit the form once and
      click that confirmation link (check `fameengineering5@gmail.com`,
      including spam) before submissions start arriving normally.
- [x] About photo — the proprietor's portrait (`images/proprietor.jpg`) is in
      the About section, with the "Rana Shabir Ahmad / Proprietor" badge on it.
- [ ] Optional: a photo of the workshop itself would add a lot. There's no
      slot for one yet — ask and it can be added (e.g. alongside Services).
- [ ] Opening hours — not on the letterhead; add a line to the Address card
      in the Contact section if you want hours displayed
- [ ] Confirm `+92 300 4689475` is the right number for the WhatsApp links
      (hero, contact, floating button) — currently assumed since it's listed
      first on the letterhead
- [ ] Optional: verify the About section text (proprietor name, service
      summary) reads the way you want — it's based on the letterhead but
      written in website voice
- [ ] **Brands marquee** — the scrolling "Brands We Repair" section (between
      Services and Why Us) currently lists common Pakistani inverter/UPS/
      electronics brand names (Inverex, Homage, Luminous, Su-Kam, APC, Kstar,
      Osaka, PEL, Dawlance, Haier, Metrix, Solar King) as **placeholders** —
      these were never confirmed as brands you actually service. In
      `index.html`, find `<!-- ===== Brands (scrolling marquee) ===== -->`
      and replace the names in **both** halves of `.marquee-track` with your
      real list (both halves must stay identical and in the same order for
      the loop to stay seamless).

## Running locally

No install needed — just open `index.html` in a browser. Or, for a local server
(recommended so relative paths behave exactly like on GitHub Pages):

```
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node (if installed)
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

The site is already pushed to `https://github.com/fameengineering/Shop_Fame`
on branch `main`. To make it live:

1. On GitHub: go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Under **Branch**, choose `main` and folder `/ (root)`, then **Save**.
4. Wait a minute, then the site will be live at:
   `https://fameengineering.github.io/Shop_Fame/`

### Custom domain (optional)

If you buy a domain (e.g. `fameengineering.com`), add a `CNAME` file to this
folder containing just the domain name, then configure the domain's DNS as
described in GitHub's Pages custom domain docs, and set it under
**Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.

## Contact form setup

GitHub Pages only serves static files — there's no server to receive form
submissions directly. The Contact section's form (`index.html`, "Send a
Message") is wired to [Formspree](https://formspree.io), a free service that
emails submissions straight to your inbox. It's already connected to
`https://formspree.io/f/xgaeneny`, tied to `fameengineering5@gmail.com`.

**To finish activating it:** Formspree requires one real submission to be
confirmed before it starts delivering normally. Fill out the form on the live
site once (any test message works), then check `fameengineering5@gmail.com`
(including spam/promotions) for a confirmation email from Formspree and click
the link in it. After that, every submission will land in that inbox.

The free plan allows 50 submissions/month, which is plenty for a shop's
contact form. The form has spam protection built in (a hidden honeypot
field) and shows a success or error message on the page without reloading.
If Formspree is ever down or unreachable, the form shows an error message
pointing visitors to the phone/WhatsApp links instead, so they're never
stuck with no way to reach you.

If you ever need to point the form at a different Formspree account or form,
just replace the URL in `index.html`:
```html
<form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/xgaeneny" method="POST">
```
